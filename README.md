# InfoEdge Hackathon 2019

For the hackathon, we created a web-based online assessment platform that could help InfoEdge hire new employees. 
Using this platform, a hiring manager or team manager can create timed/untimed tests that would contain questions (MCQ/Objective/Subjective/Code). These questions can be added by the hiring manager themselves or can be picked up randomly from a question bank. For SDE based test, a complier was integrated into the platform to help access the code output.

This repository only contains that backend source code of the application, ie, the web service.
